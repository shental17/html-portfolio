<h1>The Best Movies According to Shental</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>My Silent Voice</h3>
<p>It shows wonderful character development of the male lead who felt guilty for bullying a deaf girl and is trying to
    repent his actions by supporting the girl.</p>
<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
<p>The art was very stunning and the animation and action scenes were very well made.</p>
<h3>Jumanji</h3>
<p>It has a perfect balance between comedy and action.</p>
